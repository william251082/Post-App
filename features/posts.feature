    When  I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I send a "POST" request to "/api/posts" with body:
    """
    {
      "title": "Hello a title",
      "content": "The content is suppose to be at least 20 characters",
